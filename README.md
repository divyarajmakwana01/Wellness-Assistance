I developed the Wellness Assistance Android Application for my minor project in college. Developed an innovative Android application aimed at enhancing user fitness and wellness through personalized workout and 
nutrition management. Key features include:

•	Workout Timer: Implemented a customizable interval training timer, enabling users to create personalized exercise programs and track workout duration with features such as plan timer and stopwatch functionality.

•	Calorie Tracker: Integrated a comprehensive calorie counter that assists users in monitoring their daily caloric intake and macronutrient distribution, providing dietary recommendations tailored to their 
                   fitness goals.

•	Training Splits: Developed a split training system that organizes workouts based on muscle groups, allowing users to follow a structured weekly regimen adaptable to their personal preferences and mood.

•	Workout Videos: Provides instructional workout videos to guide users through specific exercises, ensuring proper form and technique.
